## Introduction
Hello world! I'm going to get into my third year of university. I'm studying Management Information Systems and only recently realized the benefits and privileges of being a student. That said, It's never too late to appreciate them.
## Summer Time
This summer, during my third year, I'm focused on improving my skills to be more confident when applying for internships. 
By sharing this public announcement, I aim to push myself to be more disciplined and committed to my goals.
Let's see where this dedication takes me!
